	<strong><h1>MY VIEWS ON...</h1></strong>
	<br>
	<div class="col-lg-4">
	<h3>Beer</h3>
	<p>Beer is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, and rightly so. There is never a time that a cold one doesn't suit, whether it's a crisp, refreshing lager, juicy, tart IPA or thick creamy stout.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4">
		<h3>Sausage Rolls</h3>
		<p>Sausage rolls are magnificent little tubes of pastry and sausage, however, stuff too much onion inside and the flavour becomes too potent and nowhere near as enjoyable.My personal recommendation is to try pork and mango sausage rolls because they are tasty.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-lg-4">
		<h3>Brown Sauce Vs. Red Sauce</h3>
		Brown Sauce is iconic with the Houses of Parliament on the bottle, it has the perfect amount of acidity and tanginess to accompany almost anything. On the other hand red sauce is putrid, it's the blood of the devil and is far too acidic. If you are outraged whilst reading this, then consider yourself uneducated swine.
	I hope you can find your nearest bridge and take a good run and jump.</p></div>
	<div class="col-lg-4">
		<h3>Doner Kebabs</h3>
		<p>Doner kebabs are a thing of beauty, the perfect accompaniment to the aforementioned beer. Warm or cold, today or tomorrow, it really doesn't matter. 10/10 would recommend.
